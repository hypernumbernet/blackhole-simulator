# Black Hole Simulator
_N-Body gravity simulation on 3-sphere_

The method of this simulation is NOT related the real universe's black hole.ã€€The purpose of this program is a research for the behavior of particles on 3-sphere (in 4 dimensions) space. In this simulator, all particles are located on the unit quaternion and calculated by the octonion slerp. The gravitational force between two particles is figured out by Newton's law of gravity.
